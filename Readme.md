# State Populations Map

Responsive, interactive map of the United States that displays the population of US States in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Users view the map; click on a state; and the population data is displayed in a box underneath the map. Data is from the United States Census Bureau. All interativity is accomplished with "vanilla" JavaScript.
